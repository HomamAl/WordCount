# WordCount Project

In this Django webserver I have created a wordcounter using python that counts the words inside the text box, It also analyse the most repeated words in the text.

# To run the webserver
1. Navigate to the (wordCount_project) folder
2. Run the "python3 manage.py runserver" command to get.
3. Then you should see a development server IP address to run in your browser.
