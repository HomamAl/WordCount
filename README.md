# WordCount Project

In this Django webserver I have created a wordcounter using python that counts the words inside the text box, It also analyse the most repeated words in the text.

# To run the webserver
1. Navigate to the wordCount_project --> run "python3 manage.py runserver".
2. Then you should see a development server IP address to run in the terminal.
